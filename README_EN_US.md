Used to fix parsing errors caused by differences in waypoint sharing formats between different versions of Xaero's Minimap.

Example: `Incorrect format of the shared waypoint! Error: 12`

This mod automatically converts the waypoint sharing format from older versions to the new format.

After installing this mod, some of your MCDR plugins designed for older versions of Xaero's Minimap will work properly.
